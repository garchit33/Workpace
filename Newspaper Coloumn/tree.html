         <p>In psychology and medicine, a person's environment is the people,
            physical things and places that the person lives with.
             The environment affects the growth and development of the person.
             It affects the person's behavior, body, mind and heart. Since everything
              is part of the environment of something else, the word environment
              is used to talk about many things.
              People in different fields of knowledge use the word environment differently.

      <p>Environment is everything that is around us. It can be living (biotic) or non-living (abiotic) things.
         It includes physical, chemical and other natural forces.

           Some people call themselves environmentalists.
           They think we must protect the natural environment,
           to keep it safe. Things in the natural environment
            that we value are called natural resources.
            For example; fish, insects, and forests.
            Living things live in their environment.
            They constantly interact with it and adapt themselves to conditions in their environment.
             In the environment there are different interactions between animals,
              plants, soil, water, and other living and non-living things.

         <p>Environment includes the living and nonliving things
           that an organism interacts with, or has an effect on it.
            Living elements that an organism interacts with are
            known as biotic elements: animals, plants, etc.,
            abiotic elements are non living things which include air,
            water, sunlight etc. Studying the environment means
             studying the relationships among these various things.
             An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a component of the hydrosphere.

          <h3 align="center">Natural Environment</h3>
         <p>The natural environment encompasses all living and
           non-living things occurring naturally, meaning in this
           case not artificial. The term is most often applied to
           the Earth or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses
            the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and
            natural resources that affect human survival and economic
            activity.
         </p>
          <h3 align="center">Compsition</h3>
         <p>People seldom find absolutely natural environments on Earth,
           and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural
           in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. More precisely,
           we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment,
            and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform.
         </p>
         <h3 align="center">Layers of Environment</h3>
        <p>The Earth's crust, or lithosphere, is the outermost solid
          surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different
          from underlying mantle. It has been generated greatly by igneous
          processes in which magma cools and solidifies to form solid rock.
           Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by
           the decay of radioactive elements. The mantle though solid is in a
           state of rheic convection. This convection process causes the lithospheric
            plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as plate
            tectonics. Volcanoes result primarily from the melting of subducted
            crust material or of rising mantle at mid-ocean ridges and mantle plumes.
            Predation, an organism eating another, is an example of interaction between
             living things.
             An example of interactions between non-living and living
             things is plants getting their minerals from the soil and
             making food using sunlight.
             A river is a natural watercourse,[7] usually freshwater,
              flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river.
               A few rivers simply flow into the ground and dry up completely
               before reaching another body of water.
